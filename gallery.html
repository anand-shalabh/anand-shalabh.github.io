		<h2>Polymer Physics</h2>
		<p>Studying the properties of a polymer under different circumstances has a very long history. During the time,
			huge depelopement has been done in its theoretical as well as experimental realisations. I employ theoretical
			models and computer simulations to study structure and dynamics of polymer chain under different physical conditions.</p>
