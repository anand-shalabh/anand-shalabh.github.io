	<h3>Soft Matter Physics</h3>
		<div class="box">
       		<h1>Research interests</h1>
       			<p>I am a condensed matter theorist working at the interface of soft condensed matter physics, materials science, and 
				biology. I develop and apply the tools of statistical and computational physics to study physical and biological 
				systems, including biological motors, synthetic molecular machines, colloids, thermoelectric machines, biological 
				fluids, and active matter. <!--- I follow an interdisciplinary approach working closely with physicists, chemists, 
				chemical engineers, materials scientists, and specialists in machine learning. ---> </p>
			<h2>Active Jamming</h2>
			<p>Jamming in living matter and active synthetic systems is an emergent area of research that is under intense
				attention due to its relevance to diverse physical and biological systems. In particular, jamming in living cell
				tissues have been argued to be crucial to many important processes that include the development programme
				of organs in our body. From a physics standpoint, active systems, i.e., systems in which particulates can move
				by generating their own active forces, are intrinsically far from equilibrium. I am keen to understand the
				question of jamming in these far from equilibrium systems.</p>
			
			<h2>Polymer Physics</h2>
			<p>Studying the properties of a polymer under different circumstances has a very long history. During the time,
				huge depelopement has been done in its theoretical as well as experimental realisations. I employ theoretical
				models and computer simulations to study structure and dynamics of polymer chain under different physical conditions.</p>
			
			<h2>Active matter: Microswimmers and Swarms</h2>
			<p>Study of active particles is in immense interest in last few decades. These particles show very different and 
				emergent properties compared to particles in equilibrium. I study individual as well collective behaviour
				of anisotropic microswimmers, which also include the effect of fluid-flow on the system. I study collective
				behaviour of isotropic active particles also.</p>
			
			<h2>Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics</h2>
			<p>The formulation of thermodynamic laws for the description of small-scale nonequilibrium systems in contact with
				heat and work reservoirs has deepened and extended our understanding of thermodynamics and its relation to
				microscopic laws in recent years. This novel connection has been made in various different contexts, including
				microscopic classical and quantum descriptions, mesoscopic descriptions embodied in stochastic thermodynamics.
				Study of fluctuation relations and heat dissipation in out-of-equilibrium systems also interests me.</p>
