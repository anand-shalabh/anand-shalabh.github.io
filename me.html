       		<h1>My origin</h1>
       		<p>I was born in a village near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhabua" target="blank">Bhabua</a> in district <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaimur_district" target="blank">Kaimur</a> in Bihar. It is around at 70 km from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi" target="blank">Varanasi</a>. The name of the district is given on the series of hills known as Kaimur Hills. It was a part of district Shahabad(Bhojpur/Ara) initially and then Rohtas(Sasaram). Later it became a separate district. As the name of district suggest, it has too many hills all across the Kaimur. It gives a very natural picnic spots like water-falls, hills etc. all across the district. One of the important places to visit in the district is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mundeshwari_Temple" target="blank">Mundeshwari temple</a>, which is known to be one of the oldest functional Hindu temples in India as the Archaeological Survey of India indicates the dating of the temple to be 625 CE. The temple is a protected monument under Archaeological Survey of India since 1915. It is on the top of one of the Kaimur hills series.</p>
