	<h3>My Research Interests</h3>
	<p>
		<p>I am currently working in Soft Condensed Matter Physics. I employ computer simulations and theoretical models to study the physics of soft material systems. Furthermore, my research interest also involves the study of flow properties of suspensions of macromolecules and colloids.</p> <br>
		<h2>Jamming</h2>
		<p>To come in near future...</p>
		<h2>Polymer Physics</h2>
		<p>Studying the properties of a polymer under different circumstances has a very long history. During the time, huge depelopement has been done in its theoretical as well as experimental realisations. I employ theoretical models and computer simulations to study structure and dynamics of polymer chain under different physical conditions.</p>
		<h2>Active matter: Microswimmers and Swarms</h2>
		<p>Study of active particles is in immense interest in last few decades. These particles show very different and emergent properties compared to particles in equilibrium. I study individual as well collective behaviour of anisotropic microswimmers, which also include the effect of fluid-flow on the system. I study collective behaviour of isotropic active particles also.</p>
		<h2>Nonequilibrium Statistical Physics</h2>
		<p>The formulation of thermodynamic laws for the description of small-scale nonequilibrium systems in contact with heat and work reservoirs has deepened and extended our understanding of thermodynamics and its relation to microscopic laws in recent years. This novel connection has been made in various different contexts, including microscopic classical and quantum descriptions, mesoscopic descriptions embodied in stochastic thermodynamics. Study of fluctuation relations and heat dissipation in out-of-equilibrium systems also interests me.</p>
